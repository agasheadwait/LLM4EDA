# LLM4EDA: LLM based low code platform for EDA

## Description:

LLM4EDA is a chat-based agent designed to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) and model training on a given dataset. It simplifies the EDA and training process by enabling interaction through chat-based commands.

## How it works:

1. Specify dataset location.
2. Create a prompt for the LLM model to instruct it on what tasks to perform.
3. The model takes care of the remaining tasks.

LLM4EDA makes EDA and training exceptionally easy, providing a user-friendly interface through conversation.

## Installation:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Uncomment and run the first cell in the Jupyter file.

## Features:

- **Missing Value Handling:** The platform includes functionality to handle missing values in the dataset.
  
- **Data Cleaning:** It facilitates data cleaning tasks to ensure the dataset is ready for analysis and training.
  
- **Query Answering:** Users can interactively query the system for insights and information related to the dataset.
  
- **Model Training:** LLM4EDA allows users to train machine learning models on the specified dataset.
  
- **Predictions:** After training, the platform supports making predictions using the trained model.
